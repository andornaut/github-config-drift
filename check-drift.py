"""Report where a repository's lint config has drifted from the canonical one.

None of these tools can inherit a config from elsewhere, so every repository
carries a copy and copies drift. This reads each copy through `gh api`, compares
it with configs/, and prints what differs.

It reports rather than repairs. Drift runs both ways: a repository can fall
behind, and it can also be ahead, having reached a stricter position on its own,
which is worth adopting rather than reverting. Deciding which is which needs the
diff, so the diff is what this prints.

Exits 1 when anything has drifted, 0 when nothing has.
